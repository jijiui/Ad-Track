# Ad-Track
The project is to record how many people('phones) have passed an advertisement board(adb).
  There are 2 options:
Option 1:attach an iBeacon to the adb, install an app on the phone, the app will send a record when the phone passes an iBeacon(adb).
Option 2:attach an Raspberry Pi to the adb, install an app on the phone, the app broadcasting Bluetooth Signal, the Pi will send a record when a phone passes the adb
Finally, Option 2 was regarded as a better option and improved in UI and Bluetooth state checking.
